## 1. Overview (max 3 pages)
### 1.1 Rationale
*What is the object under consideration? What is the intended usage of the model? Which issues can be investigated?*

The model is intended as an extensible general-purpose agent-based model (ABM) of an economy that introduces both Land and Organization to macroeconomic ABMs, two of the four factors of production emphasized by classical economics of a century ago. [^1] The other two factors, Labor and Capital, have already been included in many macroeconomic ABMs. The model can be used to investigate a number of issues:
- The influence of land availability and productivity on the economy and, conversely, the influence of economic activity on the productive capacity of land. 
- The influence of supply network structures on macroeconomic patterns
- The influence of indexed pricing methods (a method of Organization) on economic patterns and changes in ecological integrity
